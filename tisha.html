        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Samia Haque Tisha</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center;">I saw her first in this web design class. I had heard that someone from Software Department will join with us but I don't know why I assumed that it would be a boy. I talked to her and I had a feeling that we would get along really well. I was
            happy when I heard she feels the same about me. I wasn't expecting she would say that, but it made me happy. I would love to have her as my friend.</p>
